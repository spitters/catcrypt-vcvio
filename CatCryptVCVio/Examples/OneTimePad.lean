# Bridge Example — One-Time Pad via `evalDist` equality

Demonstrates the transfer pattern: any two `ProbComp Bool` games with equal
`evalDist` yield zero `Advantage` on their `probCompLift`s.

For the full one-time-pad proof (perfect secrecy via bijection coupling), see
the upstream `Examples/OneTimePad.lean`. That proof lives at the `GameEquiv` /
`Pr[= · | _]` level. The bridge lemma below is what lets you *use* a VCVio
`evalDist` equality — from perfect secrecy, a bijection coupling, or any other
source — as a CatCrypt zero-advantage statement.
