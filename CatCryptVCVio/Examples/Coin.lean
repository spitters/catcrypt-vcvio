# Bridge Example — Coin flip

Smallest possible example exercising the bridge: a ProbComp that flips a coin,
lifted via `probCompLift` to an SPComp, with its `prTrue` computed via the
probability-preservation lemma.

This is the pattern to follow for any stateless VCVio reduction: state the
game in `ProbComp`, compute `Pr[= true | ...]` in VCVio, then transfer to a
CatCrypt `Advantage` or `prTrue` statement via `prTrue_probCompLift`.
