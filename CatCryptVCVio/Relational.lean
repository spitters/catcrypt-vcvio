# VCVio Bridge — Relational / Advantage transfer (Phase 4)

Bridges VCVio's probability-level reasoning (`Pr[= x | mx]`, `evalDist`) to
CatCrypt's relational and advantage-level reasoning (`Advantage`, `prTrue`) via
`probCompLift`.

The main content is the **probability-preservation lemma**: the probability that
`probCompLift mx` returns `true` from the empty heap is exactly `Pr[= true | mx]`.
This is what makes VCVio's quantitative reductions transfer into CatCrypt
`Advantage` bounds.

## Main results

* `probCompLift_apply` — pointwise evaluation of `probCompLift mx h`
* `prTrue_probCompLift` — `prTrue (probCompLift mx) CatCrypt.Core.Heap.empty = Pr[= true | mx]`
* `advantage_probCompLift_le_of_probOutput_diff` — VCVio probability bounds
  transfer to CatCrypt advantage bounds

## Note on the full `RelTriple ↔ rHoare` equivalence

Upstream VCVio's relational program logic (`VCVio.ProgramLogic.Relational`) is
built on `SPMF.Coupling`; CatCrypt's `rHoare` (`CatCrypt.Relational.Judgment`)
is built on `CatCrypt.Prob.Coupling`. The two coupling structures carry the same
information but differ in how the marginal laws are stated. A full
isomorphism proof is out of scope here — the quantitative bridges in this file
cover the primary use case (transferring VCVio advantage bounds into CatCrypt
`Advantage` / `UCEmulates` statements).

/-- Evaluating `probCompLift mx` at an output `(a, h')` starting from heap `h`:
    the heap must be unchanged (`h = h'`) and the probability is that of `mx`
    returning `a`. For any other final heap, the probability is `0`. -/

/-! ## Probability preservation -/

/-- The key compatibility lemma: the probability that `probCompLift mx` returns
    `true` (starting from the empty heap) is exactly the VCVio `Pr[= true | mx]`.

    This is the identity that lets VCVio's probability bounds transfer to
    CatCrypt's `Advantage` statements. -/

/-! ## Advantage transfer -/

/-- VCVio probability bounds transfer to CatCrypt advantage bounds. If two
    `ProbComp Bool` games have `Pr[= true | ·]` differing by at most `ε`, then
    their `probCompLift`s have `Advantage` at most `ε`. -/
